# Samples of Generated _Json Schema_ Pictures

The _json schema_ in the *schemas* folder are used to generate the _dot files_ and the _png files_ in the *schemaout* folder by the _../bin/gensamples.dart_ script. To do similar you need Graphviz installed. Many of the sample schema came from [this schema repository](https://github.com/fge/sample-json-schemas).
